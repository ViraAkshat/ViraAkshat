•Dual Booting:
	So, there was a video about how to dual boot Ubuntu with Windows 10. 
	However, it did not work for me, reason being my laptop has Optane memory and dual booting such a laptop needs a different process. 
	The following video explains the process very well:	https://youtu.be/2uXgbF3P2F8

Also, this won't solve the problem fully. After each kernel update you have to follow the following procedure
(I got this in the comment section of above video):
1. Disable optane from windows
2. Switch to AHCI
3. Go to ubuntu via chroot (via Live USB) or boot from an older kernel
4. Run "sudo update-initramfs && update-grub"
   (If chroot, it won't add windows to grub. Reboot to ubuntu and update-grub)
5. Switch back to RST Optane
6. Enable Optane on Windows

•Keyboard Shortcuts:
Ubuntu offers a lot of keyboard shortcuts to make life easier. Here are some of them:
1. Super Key(the windows key):
	You want to open an application? 
		Press the super key and search for the application. 
		If the application is not installed, it will even suggest applications from software center.

	You want to see the running applications?
		Press super key and it will show you all the running GUI applications and workspaces on the RHS.

2. Ctrl + Alt +  T:
	Opens the terminal

3. Super + L :
	Locks the screen

4. Super + D :
	Minimizes all the windows & if pressed again maximizes them as they were previously

5. Super + A :
	Opens the application menu

6. Super + Tab or Alt + Tab :
	Switches between the running windows/applications

7. Super + Arrow keys :
	Maximize, move the window to right/left edge

8. Super + M :
	Toggle the notification tray

9. Ctrl + Alt + Arrow :
	Switch between Workspaces
